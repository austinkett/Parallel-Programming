Note:
The OMP program is just OpenMP. The MPI program is a combination of OpenMP and MPI.For some reason MPI wouldn't compile if I used and functions in my code and I spend two days trying to debug it to no avail, therefore it is all in the main (sorry). 

Compile OMP program with:
icc -qopenmp omp_test.c -o omp_test
Run it with:
qsub omp_test.sub

Compile MPI program with:
mpiicc -qopenmp -std=c99 mpiTest.c -o mpiTest
Run MPI program with:
qsub mpiTest.sub

It uses the files in OMP_WORK to run (They go in the directory no need to move files out). Everything in the program runs correctly to the best of my knowledge. The times for the OMP program are from approximately 2.72GB of data. The times for the MPI program are from approximately 6.96GB of data. Files are reused and queued up a lot so I did not have to store a lot.
